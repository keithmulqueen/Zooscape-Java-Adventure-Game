# Zooscape-Java-Adventure-Game
This game was developed to implement several design patterns into a singular game. Developed in Java, it is an adventure game where you try to escape from a dangerous zoo filled with deadly animals. Originally based on a concept I came up with for a 3D modelling class, I eventually went on to develop the game in Java.
